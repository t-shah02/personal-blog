Hello World,

Welcome to my blog! This is just a testing post, as I figure out the awesome features of [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs).

Look forward to more posts relating to my projects as a full-stack developer, reviews on anime figures, my thoughts on LLMs and AI tools in the dev space,
and my life in general.
